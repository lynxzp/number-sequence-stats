This library designed for fast and efficient calculate basic statistical data of a big sequence of numbers, without loading all data into memory.

It directly calculate:

* min
* max
* sum
* mean
* variance
* standard deviation

And use t-digest algorithm to approximately calculate quantiles and build a chart.

T-digest is optional. Without t-digest, library computing statistic few times faster. As example six seconds for a one billion numbers.
